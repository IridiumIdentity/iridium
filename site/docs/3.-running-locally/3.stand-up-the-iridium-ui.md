# Stand up the Iridium Management UI

## Clone the Repo
```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:IridiumIdentity/admin-ui.git
```

## `cd` into the Angular project and install dependencies
```shell
$ cd admin-ui && npm install
```


## Serve locally
````shell
$ ng serve
````

The next step is log in the management UI by using
a social provider (such as GitHub) to access the system by visiting [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) in your browser.

From here, you can create tenants, associate social providers, single page applications or server apps in via the UI to be secured by Iridium.
