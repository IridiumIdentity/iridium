# Stand up locally with Docker

### You'll need the following to run iridium locally:
* [Node 18](https://nodejs.org/en)
* [Java 17](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/)

Iridium is dependent on an RDBMS system such as [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) or [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/)

We will use Docker Compose to simplify the setup process.  You can go about completing this step by either checking out the [repo locally](#serve-iridium-from-the-repo) or
using the [Docker Compose file contents below](#serve-iridium-using-the-docker-compose-file-contents-below).

### Serve Iridium from the repo

Clone the repo
```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:IridiumIdentity/iridium.git
```
`cd` into the project
```shell
$ cd iridium
```
Before running the compose command below be sure to set the environment variable HOST_INTERNAL.  This ip address should be set to whatever your default gateway is.  This is typically the ip address of your router on a home network.  The address below is just an example.
```shell
export HOST_INTERNAL=192.168.1.x
```
Stand up mariadb, the latest version of the core iridium server
```shell
$ docker compose -f tools/schedulers/compose/local-iridium-compose.yml up -d
```

At this point you have a version of the Iridium core server and an instance of MariaDB
We still need to initialize the database with specific data for Iridium to function.

You can verify this by executing `docker ps`, you should see similar output like below
```shell
 docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                        COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                        NAMES
a44c37b6d4c1   mariadb:10.6.11                              "docker-entrypoint.s…"   6 seconds ago   Up 3 seconds   0.0.0.0:3306->3306/tcp                       mariadb
b919d4ffcf56   iridiumidentity/iridium-core-server:latest   "java -jar /opt/java…"   6 seconds ago   Up 4 seconds   0.0.0.0:8381->8381/tcp                       iridium
```

It may take the iridium core server about 30 seconds to fully come up.  You can verify all is good by watching the logs by
executing `docker logs iridium -f`.

When you see the following, the server is ready to go.
```shell
main] o.s.b.w.embedded.tomcat.TomcatWebServer  : Tomcat started on port(s): 8381 (http) with context path ''
main] software.iridium.api.Iridium             : Started Iridium in 64.841 seconds (process running for 74.472)
```

[Next, you should initialize the database](#initialize-with-iridium-without-a-social-provider)

## Initialize the Iridium Database

Iridium needs specific data entities to exist for it to function. This guide demonstrates how to use the iridium CLI
to execute this task.  This document assumes you have downloaded and unpacked the binary distribution of Iridium in a
previous step as detail [here](1.Install-the-CLI.md).

To initialize the database execute the following command.  Again we are expecting you to be in the top level folder of
expanded tar.gz distribution you downloaded and unpacked earlier.

**NOTE**
You can initialize Iridium with or without a social provider at start up.  Quick links are below.  Iridium init is meant
to be non-destructive in that if you initialize the database once it will not work again.  You will need to bring your
containers all the way down to run the `init` function again.


## Initialize with Iridium with the GitHub Login Provider

Follow the directions [here](2.run-iridium-locally.md#initialize-with-iridium-with-a-login-provider), then come back to this page.

Upon successful initialization of the database you'll see similar output.  At this point you can start to create your own tenant and applications
in Iridium to be secured.
```shell
06:22:59.884 [main] INFO  software.iridium.cli.command.InitCommand - ########################################
06:22:59.884 [main] INFO  software.iridium.cli.command.InitCommand - Database successfully initialized
06:22:59.884 [main] INFO  software.iridium.cli.command.InitCommand - ########################################
06:22:59.884 [main] INFO  software.iridium.cli.command.InitCommand - Iridium Management Application ID is ${someApplicationId}
06:22:59.885 [main] INFO  software.iridium.cli.command.InitCommand - Be sure to place this in the appropriate environment.ts file
```

From here you need to take your generated id `${someApplicationId}` and [stand up the Iridium Management UI](#stand-up-the-iridium-management-ui).


## Stand up the Iridium Management UI
The rest of this document assumes you have cloned the iridium repository, and you are in the root directory of project.

Update your environment.ts file with correct application ID.  From the top level directory it's located at:
```shell
iridium-angular-client/projects/iridium-ui/src/environments/environment.ts
```

The file should look like this before you add your client id

```shell
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  iridium: {
    domain: 'http://localhost:8381/',
    redirectUri: 'http://localhost:4200/callback',
    clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
    errorPath: '/error'
  }
};
```

After the change it will look like this.  Keep in mind to swap out your real application id for `${someApplicationId}`

```shell
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  iridium: {
    domain: 'http://localhost:8381/',
    redirectUri: 'http://localhost:4200/callback',
    clientId: '${someApplicationId}',
    errorPath: '/error'
  }
};
```

`cd` into the Angular project
```shell
$ cd iridium-angular-client/
```

build the `ngx-iridium-client` and the management UI.
````shell
$ ng build ngx-iridium-client && ng serve
````

At this point you are ready to use Iridium to secure your system.  
You've stood up the  Iridium Core Server, and the management UI.

The next step is log in the management UI using either the local user you created (username/password) or the by using
a social provider (such as GitHub) to access the system by visiting [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) in your browser.

From here, you can create tenants and associate single page applications or server apps in the UI to be secured by Iridium.
