# Stand up a locally

### Prerequisites

You will need.

 * [Node 18](https://nodejs.org/en)
 * [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

Iridium is dependent on an RDBMS system such as [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) or [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) and a
SMTP server.

We will use Docker Compose to simplify the setup process.  You can go about completing this step by either checking out the [repo locally](#serve-iridium-from-the-repo) or
using the [Docker Compose file contents below](#serve-iridium-using-the-docker-compose-file-contents-below).

### Serve Iridium from the repo

Clone the repo
```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:IridiumIdentity/iridium.git
```
`cd` into the project
```shell
$ cd iridium
```
Stand up mariadb, the latest version of the core iridium server, and the fake smtp server
```shell
$ docker compose -f tools/schedulers/compose/local-iridium-compose.yml up -d
```

At this point you have a version of the Iridium core server, an instance of MariaDB, and an instance of [Fake SMTP Server](https://github.com/gessnerfl/fake-smtp-server)
We still need to initialize the database with specific data for Iridium to function.  

You can verify this by executing `docker ps`, you should see similar output like below
```shell
 docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                        COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                        NAMES
a44c37b6d4c1   mariadb:10.6.11                              "docker-entrypoint.s…"   6 seconds ago   Up 3 seconds   0.0.0.0:3306->3306/tcp                       mariadb
9b9005ad9662   gessnerfl/fake-smtp-server                   "java -Djava.securit…"   6 seconds ago   Up 4 seconds   8025/tcp, 8081/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp   fake-smtp-server
b919d4ffcf56   iridiumidentity/iridium-core-server:latest   "java -jar /opt/java…"   6 seconds ago   Up 4 seconds   0.0.0.0:8381->8381/tcp                       iridium
```

It may take the iridium core server about 30 seconds to fully come up.  You can verify all is good by watching the logs by 
executing `docker logs iridium -f`.  

When you see the following, the server is ready to go.
```shell
main] o.s.b.w.embedded.tomcat.TomcatWebServer  : Tomcat started on port(s): 8381 (http) with context path ''
main] software.iridium.api.Iridium             : Started Iridium in 64.841 seconds (process running for 74.472)
```

[Next, you should initialize the database](#initialize-with-iridium-without-a-social-provider)

### Serve Iridium using the Docker Compose file contents below
Place the below yaml in file to stand up Iridium locally.

```

You can use Docker Compose to create the system locally by executing the below:

```shell
$ docker compose -f path/to/your/compose/file.yml up -d
```

## Initialize the Iridium Database

Iridium needs specific data entities to exist for it to function. This guide demonstrates how to use the iridium CLI
to execute this task.  This document assumes you have downloaded and unpacked the binary distribution of Iridium in a
previous step as detail [here](1.Install-the-CLI.md).

To initialize the database execute the following command.  Again we are expecting you to be in the top level folder of
expanded tar.gz distribution you downloaded and unpacked earlier.

### Initialize with Iridium without a social provider

This will initialize the system to only accept a username (email) and password as user credentials.

```shell
$ ./bin/iridium  init \
--host=localhost \
--port=3306 \
--user=root \
--password \
--admin-password \
--admin-email=you@somewhere.com
```

The CLI tool should prompt your for the database password.  Enter the password you configured upon standing up
the database.
```shell
$ Enter value for --password (the database password): 
```

Next, it will ask for your admin user password.  This is the password you will use along with the admin-email you passed
to log in to the management UI
```shell
$ Enter value for --admin-password (the admin password):
```

Upon successful initialization of the database you'll see similar output
```shell
06:22:59.884 [main] INFO  software.iridium.cli.command.InitCommand - ########################################
06:22:59.884 [main] INFO  software.iridium.cli.command.InitCommand - Database successfully initialized
06:22:59.884 [main] INFO  software.iridium.cli.command.InitCommand - ########################################
06:22:59.884 [main] INFO  software.iridium.cli.command.InitCommand - Iridium Management Application ID is ${someApplicationId}
06:22:59.885 [main] INFO  software.iridium.cli.command.InitCommand - Be sure to place this in the appropriate environment.ts file
```

From here you need to take your generated id `${someApplicationId}` and [stand up the Iridium Management UI](#stand-up-the-iridium-management-ui).

### Initialize with Iridium with GitHub Login
If you want to allow users to log in to the Iridium Management app with their GitHub account you can allow this here
following the directions below:

Again we are expecting you to be in the top level folder of
expanded tar.gz distribution you downloaded and unpacked earlier. In this example, we are passing the flag to allow users to register
with the Iridium tenant using GitHub by passing the flag `--allow-github=true`.


```shell
$ ./bin/iridium init \
--host=localhost \
--port=3306 \
--user=root \
--password \
--allow-github=true
```

The CLI tool should prompt your for the database password.  Enter the password you configured upon standing up
the database.
```shell
$ Enter value for --password (the database password): 
```

Next the CLI will prompt for a GitHub Oauth application credentials.  If you don't have a GitHub application ready to use,
you can [follow the directions here to create one](../4.-connecting-social-identity-providers/create-github-application.md)

Enter your GitHub OAuth application id
```shell
$ Enter value for github client id: my-client-id
```
Enter your GitHub OAuth application secret
```shell
$ Enter value for github client secret: my-client-secret
```

From here, you should be able to log in to the Iridium Management UI using your GitHub account. At this point you've
stood up the system with an Iridium tenant for and application for managing Iridium. At this point you can start to create your own tenant and applications
in Iridium to be secured.


Next the CLI will prompt for a GitHub Oauth application credentials.  If you don't have a GitHub application ready to use,
you can [follow the directions here to create one](../4.-connecting-social-identity-providers/create-github-application.md)

Enter your GitHub OAuth application id
```shell
$ Enter value for github client id: my-client-id
```
Enter your GitHub OAuth application secret
```shell
$ Enter value for github client secret: my-client-secret
```

Upon successful initialization of the database you'll see similar output
```shell
06:22:59.884 [main] INFO  software.iridium.cli.command.InitCommand - ########################################
06:22:59.884 [main] INFO  software.iridium.cli.command.InitCommand - Database successfully initialized
06:22:59.884 [main] INFO  software.iridium.cli.command.InitCommand - ########################################
06:22:59.884 [main] INFO  software.iridium.cli.command.InitCommand - Iridium Management Application ID is ${someApplicationId}
06:22:59.885 [main] INFO  software.iridium.cli.command.InitCommand - Be sure to place this in the appropriate environment.ts file
```

From here you need to take your generated id `${someApplicationId}` and [stand up the Iridium Management UI](#stand-up-the-iridium-management-ui).


## Stand up the Iridium Management UI
The rest of this document assumes you have cloned the iridium repository, and you are in the root directory of project. 

Update your environment.ts file with correct application ID.  From the top level directory it's located at:
```shell
iridium-angular-client/projects/iridium-ui/src/environments/environment.ts
```

The file should look like this before you add your client id

```shell
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  iridium: {
    domain: 'http://localhost:8381/',
    redirectUri: 'http://localhost:4200/callback',
    clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
    errorPath: '/error'
  }
};
```

After the change it will look like this.  Keep in mind to swap out your real application id for `${someApplicationId}`

```shell
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  iridium: {
    domain: 'http://localhost:8381/',
    redirectUri: 'http://localhost:4200/callback',
    clientId: '${someApplicationId}',
    errorPath: '/error'
  }
};
```

`cd` into the Angular project
```shell
$ cd iridium-angular-client/
```

build the `ngx-iridium-client` and the management UI.
````shell
$ ng build ngx-iridium-client && ng serve
````

At this point you are ready to use Iridium to secure your system.  
You've stood up the  Iridium Core Server, A Fake SMTP Server, and the management UI.  

The next step is log in the management UI using either the local user you created (username/password) or the by using 
a social provider (such as GitHub) to access the system by visiting [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) in your browser.

From here, you can create tenants and associate single page applications or server apps in the UI to be secured by Iridium.
