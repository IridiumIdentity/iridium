# 1. Stand up a locally

### Prerequisites

You will need.

 * [Node 18](https://nodejs.org/en)
 * [Java 17](https://adoptium.net/)
 * [Maven 3.8.4](https://maven.apache.org/) or greater
 * [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

Iridium is dependent on an RDBMS system such as [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) or [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/).

We will use Docker Compose to simplify the setup process.  

Clone the repo
```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:IridiumIdentity/iridium.git
```
`cd` into the project
```shell
$ cd iridium
```
Stand up mariadb, the latest version of the core iridium server, and the admin UI.
```shell
$ docker-compose -f tools/schedulers/compose/local-iridium-compose.yml up -d
```

At this point you have a version of the Iridium core server, an instance of MariaDB, and the Iridium management UI.
We still need to init the database with specific data for Iridium to function.
