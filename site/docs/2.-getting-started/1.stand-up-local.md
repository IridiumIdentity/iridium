# 1. Stand up a locally

### Prerequisites

You will need.

 * [Node 18](https://nodejs.org/en)
 * [Java 17](https://adoptium.net/)
 * [Maven 3.8.4](https://maven.apache.org/) or greater
 * [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

Iridium is dependent on an RDBMS system such as [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) or [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/).

**Note**: Currently, the management UI is managed by separate build process.  In future revisions will work to consolidate the
separate build processes into easier to manage commands.  You can build the management UI by following the commands below.
All commands are assuming you are starting at the top level directory of the Iridium project.  We will work to improve 
this build process in future releases.

```shell
$ cd iridium-angular-client
$ npm install
$ ng build ngx-iridium-client
$ ng serve
```

We will use Docker Compose to simplify the setup process.  

Clone the repo
```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:IridiumIdentity/iridium.git
```
`cd` into the project
```shell
$ cd iridium
```
Stand up mariadb, the latest version of the core iridium server, and the admin UI.
```shell
$ docker-compose -f tools/schedulers/compose/local-iridium-compose.yml up -d
```

At this point you have a version of the Iridium core server, an instance of an RDBMS system, and the Iridium managment UI.
We still need to init the database with specific data for Iridium to function.
