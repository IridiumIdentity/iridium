# 1. Stand up a locally

Iridium is dependent on an RDBMS system such as [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) or [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/).

We will use Docker Compose to simplify the setup process.

Clone the repo
```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:IridiumIdentity/iridium.git
```
`cd` into the project
```shell
$ cd iridium
```
Stand up mariadb, the latest version of the core iridium server, and the admin UI.
```shell
$ docker-compose -f tools/schedulers/compose/local-iridium-compose.yml up -d
```
