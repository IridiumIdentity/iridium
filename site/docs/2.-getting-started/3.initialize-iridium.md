# 3. Initialize the Iridium Database

Iridium needs specific data entities to exist for it to function. This guide demonstrates how to use the iridium CLI
to execute this task.  This document assumes you have downloaded and unpacked the binary distribution of Iridium in a
previous step as detail [here](2.Install-the-CLI.md).

To intialize the database execute the following command.  Again we are expecting you to be in the top level folder of 
expanded tar.gz distribution you downloaded and unpacked earlier.

```shell
$ ./bin/iridium init \
  --host=localhost \
  --port=3306 \
  --user=root \
  --allow-github=false \
  --password
```

The CLI tool should prompt your for the database password.  Enter the password you configured upon standing up
the database.
```shell
$ Enter value for --password (the database password): 
```
