#  Authorization Code Flow

Building Authorization Code Flow libraries for use with Iridium requires a few steps.

## Understanding the Authorization Code Flow

The authorization code flow is used to get access tokens and refresh tokens.  This flow is based
on redirection.

![Authorization Code Flow](../images/authorization-code-flow.png)

1. The resource owner (end-user) visits a third-party client (web application)
2. The resource owner selects the “sign up with Google” button in the client. The user-agent (browser) directs the resource owner to the Google sign-in page.
3. The resource owner (end-user) authenticates and authorizes the authorization server to grant access to the resource owner's information (in this case it could be the email address and profile information) to the third-party client.
4. After the resource owner (end-user) authorizes access, the authorization server redirects the user-agent (browser) back to the original third-party client with an authorization code and typically a state parameter
5. The third-party client requests an access token with the received authorization code and associated redirect URI
6. The authorization authenticates the client, validates the authorization code and the accompanying redirect URI matches the URI provided in step D.  If the request is valid the authorization server returns back with an access token and an optional refresh token. 

## Endpoints used in the Authorization Code Flow
When building clients for Iridium, there are two main endpoints you need to be familiar with.

1. [The authorization endpoint](#the-authorization-endpoint)
2. [The token endpoint](#the-token-endpoint)

## The authorization endpoint

* Method: `POST`
* Endpoint: `${serverRoot}/oauth/external/authorize`
* Parameters

    * `response_type`
    * `state`
    * `scope`
    * `redirect_uri`
    * `client_id`
    * `provider`
    * `code_challenge_method`
    * `code_challenge`

## The token endpoint

* Method: `POST`
* Endpoint: `oauth/token`
* Parameters
  * `authorization_code`
    * required
  * `code`
    * required
  * `redirect_uri`
    * required
  * `client_id`
    * required, unless authentication is supplied via a HTTP Basic Auth header using the client ID as the 
      username and secret as the password, or by accepting the strings in the post body as `client_id` and `client_secret`
  * `code_verfier`
