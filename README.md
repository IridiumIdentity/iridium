## Why build Iridium?

We've used other closed-source providers and found that the biggest issue when things go wrong is
the options for support are minimal, communities don't exist, and because of this people are often left making best guesses
on how to implement authentication or authorization into their system. 
Iridium is here to give you a path forward in managing your customers seamless log in experience.

## How can I contribute?
There are many places to start.  You can start with documentation, fixing bugs related to issues, helping with building examples, etc.

We are looking forward to you telling us how we can make the project better.
