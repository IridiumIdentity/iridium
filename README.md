## What is iridium?
Iridium is an OAuth2.x-compliant identity management system.  Iridium is 100% free and open source. We encourage and support an active, healthy community that accepts contributions from the public – including you!

## What problem does it solve?
The OAuth2.x RFC is full of great details, but it mainly focuses on defining the interfaces on how different identity systems can work together.  There are many implementation details in the spec which are not defined on purpose, which requires developers to make the best guess at how security, authentication, authorization, etc should be implemented within their own system.  The goal of the OAuth framework isn’t meant to restrict how implementation should be done, but to allow neighboring systems to be able to exchange data with one another securely.

Iridium helps developers secure their applications or systems the right way by providing an opinionated implementation on how to solve identity management for systems of any size.

## Welcoming Community
We are just getting started!
* We are welcoming, inclusive, and friendly
* Our end goal isn't to hang on to Iridium.  Once we get the project and community built up enough, we'd like to donate the
  the project to a larger managing organization. Help us get there.
* We need your help, this project is early in terms of open source releases, we need as many eyes on it as we can.
* [Participate in discussions on Github](https://github.com/IridiumIdentity/iridium/discussions)

## Why build Iridium?

Ever hear the statement "Don't roll your own auth".  Authentication/Authorization
is a problem that must be solved for all applications to function securely. But that doesn't mean it should require you
to be stuck with vendor lock-in. We've used other providers and found that the biggest issue when things go wrong is
the options for support are minimal, communities don't exist, and because of this people are often left making best guesses
on how to implement authentication or authorization into their system. With Iridium our intent is to put the power back in
your hands to take control of your system and infrastructure.


## How can I contribute?
There are many places to start.  You can start with documentation, fixing bugs related to issues, helping with building examples, etc.

We are looking forward to you telling us how we can make the project better.
